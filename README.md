HOURLY STOCK PREDICTION:

1. EDA for sales for a grocery department store.
2. Predictive model to for better invertory managment:
      1. Data from multiple IOT sensor taken into account.
      2. Data cleaned and reformatted for consistency.
      3. Data from different sourcews merged.
      4. Continous predictive model developed.
      5. Feature Importance analysis.


Based on the data from given sensors, a model with Mean Absolute Error of 0.21 was developed.
The model will be able to predict hourly stock of a product within the range of + 0.21 to – 0.21.
The relatively low accuracy of the model is mostly to do with the limited amount of data made available. Better performing models can be developed given more data.

• KeyFeaturesinclude:
1. Unit Price of Product
2. Temperature
3. Hour
4. Quantity
5. Day of the week


   
• Most categorical features contribute little to impact model performance.
• However, no solid conclusion can be made due to scarcity of training data.

Conclusion:

While the current model provides a basic level of prediction accuracy, its performance can be significantly enhanced with a larger dataset. This would enable more reliable inventory management, reducing stockouts and overstock situations.

For more detailed insights and future improvements, additional data collection and analysis are recommended.
